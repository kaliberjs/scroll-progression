# `@kaliber/scroll-progression`
Track the scroll progression between two points within an overflow container as a normalized number between 0 and 1. 

## Motivation
Animating things in reaction to scroll should be easy, also if you don't want to use GSAP's ScrollTrigger library. This library tracks you scroll progression and calls you back with a value between 0 and 1. This is perfect for animation, since you can apply easing functions to it and use linear interpolation (`lerp`) to map it to any output domain that you like. Total freedom!

## Usage

This library tracks to progression of a given element between two points within it overflowing container. These two points are called scroll triggers. A scroll trigger consists of an `anchor` and (optionally) an `offset`. The anchor is a relative value based on the container's height. `0` means the top of the container, `1` means the bottom. If you need to increase or decrease with an amount of pixels, you can use the `offset` property for this. 

For instance: a scroll trigger describing the point 100 pixels below the top of an element is described as follows:

```js
{ anchor: 0, offset: 100 }
```

To ease the use of this library, a set of constants is exported which describe the most common scroll triggers:

| Constant  | Value  |
|---|---|
| top  | `{ anchor: 0, offset: 0 }`  |
| center  | `{ anchor: 0.5, offset: 0 }`  |
| bottom  | `{ anchor: 1, offset: 0 }`  |

Below are some examples to help you get a feeling for this. To view some examples in a practical setting, check the [`/example`](https://github.dev/kaliberjs/scroll-progression) folder!

#### Example 1

- Start when the __top of the element__ reaches the __bottom of the container__
- End when the __bottom of the element__ reaches the __top of the container__

```js
import { onScrollProgression, constants as c } from '@kaliber/scroll-progression'

const cleanup = onScrollProgression({
  element: component,
  start: { element: c.top, container: c.bottom },
  end: { element: c.bottom, container: c.top },
  onChange(progression) { /* Do something */ }
})
```

#### Example 2

- Start when the __top of the element__ reaches the __bottom of the container__
- End when the __top of the element__ reaches __200 pixels above the bottom of the container__

```js
import { onScrollProgression, constants as c } from '@kaliber/scroll-progression'

onScrollProgression({
  element: component,
  start: { element: c.bottom, container: c.bottom },
  end: { element: c.top, container: { anchor: 1, offset: -200 } },
  onChange(progression) { /* Do something */ }
})
```

#### Example 3

- Start when the __bottom of the element__ reaches the __bottom of the container__
- End when the __top of the element__ reaches the __top of the container__

```js
import { onScrollProgression, constants as c } from '@kaliber/scroll-progression'

const { ref } = onScrollProgression({
  element: component,
  start: { element: c.bottom, container: c.bottom },
  end: { element: c.top, container: c.top },
  onChange(progression) { /* Do something */ }
})
```

#### Example 4
- Start when the *top of the element* reaches the *bottom of the container*
- End when the *top of the element* reaches the point *between the bottom and center of the container*

```js
import { onScrollProgression, constants as c } from '@kaliber/scroll-progression'

const { ref } = onScrollProgression({
  element: component,
  start: { element: c.bottom, container: c.bottom },
  end: { element: c.top, container: { anchor: 0.75 } },
  onChange(progression) { /* Do something */ }
})
```

### Usage with React

```js
import { useScrollProgression, constants as c } from '@kaliber/scroll-progression'

const { ref } = useScrollProgression({
  start: { element: c.top, container: c.bottom },
  end: { element: c.bottom, container: c.top },
  onChange(progression) { /* Do something */ }
})
```

### Usage with `react-spring`

If you always use `useScrollProgression` together with `react-spring` it might reduce noise if you implement the following custom hook:

```js
function useAnimatedScrollProgression({ start, end, getSpringProps }) {
  const [spring, springApi] = useSpring(() => ({ 
    ...getSpringProps(0), 
    config: { tension: 500, friction: 35 } 
  }))

  const { ref } = useAnimatedScrollProgression({
    start,
    end,
    onChange(input) {
      spring.start(getSpringProps(input)) })
    }
  })

  return { ref, spring }
}
```

Usage:

```js
const { ref, spring } = useAnimatedScrollProgression({
  start: { element: c.top, container: c.bottom },
  end: { element: c.top, container: c.center },
  getSpringProps: x => ({
    opacity: x,
    scale: lerp({ start: 0.5, end: 1, input: easeOut(x) })
  })
})
```

## Tips & Gotcha's

### Do NOT use `vh` units in your page

This might be a hard one, but when using scroll-based animations, you should really avoid using `vh` units. These re-layout your whole page when resizing leading to noticable jag on mobile. On mobile this resizing is triggered often (when your navigation bar(s) show or hide) which is why this is an issue.

The introduction of [large and small viewport units](https://www.bram.us/2021/07/08/the-large-small-and-dynamic-viewports/) will resolve this issue.

### Optimize performance with css `contain`

If you have a large page with animated components, you might start to notice some performance issues. If this is the case, you can mark you animated components with `contain: layout paint style;`. This allows the browser to make certain [optimizations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain) during recalculation. Leave out properties which cause issues, for instance `paint` if you component overflows it's bounding box. 

__ðŸš¨ Gotcha:__ *If you put `contain: layout;` on an element, don't but the `ref` returned by `useScrollProgression` on the same element.*
